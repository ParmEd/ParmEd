Description
===========

ParmEd is a package designed to facilitate creating and easily manipulating
molecular systems that are fully described by a common classical force field.
Supported force fields include Amber, CHARMM, AMOEBA, and several others that
share a similar functional form (e.g., GROMOS).

ParmEd is capable of reading and writing to a wide array of different file
formats, like the Amber topology and coordinate files, CHARMM PSF, parameter,
topology, and coordinate files, Tinker parameter, topology, and coordinate
files, and many others. The expressive central data structure (the ``Structure``
class) makes it easy to quickly and safely manipulate a chemical system, its
underlying topology, and force field parameters describing its potential energy
function.

There are two parts of ParmEd---a documented API that you can incorporate into
your own Python scripts and programs, and a GUI/CLI pair of programs that
provide a means to quickly perform various modifications to chemical systems for
rapid prototyping.

The API also provides bindings to the [OpenMM](https://simtk.org/home/openmm)
library, permitting you to carry out full molecular dynamics investigations
using ParmEd on high-performant hardware, like AMD and NVidia GPUs.

Installing ParmEd
=================

To install ParmEd, either clone this git repository or download [the latest
release](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd/releases) and unpack the resulting
tarball. This should create a new ParmEd source code directory. Change to that
directory and build ParmEd with the command

```
python setup.py install
```

Note, if you are using the system Python, you may need to either run the above
command as root (e.g., by using ``sudo``) or add the ``--user`` flag to install
it to your home directory. I would suggest the latter choice.

AMBER user can overwrite installed version by

```
python setup.py install --prefix=$AMBERHOME
```

Testing ParmEd
========

In order to automatically run the ParmEd tests, execute the following:

```
cd test
nosetests .
```

Examples
========

```bash
import parmed as pmd

# convert GROMACS topology to AMBER format
gmx_top = pmd.load_file('pmaawaterFE20mer2.top', xyz='pmaawaterFE20mer2.gro')
gmx_top.save('pmaa.top', format='amber')
gmx_top.save('pmaa.crd', format='rst7')

# convert AMBER topology to GROMACS, CHARMM formats
amber = pmd.load_file('prmtop', 'inpcrd')
# Save a GROMACS topology and GRO file
amber.save('gromacs.top')
amber.save('gromacs.gro')

# Save a CHARMM PSF and crd file
amber.save('charmm.psf')
amber.save('charmm.crd')

# convert mol2 to pdb file
mol2_parm = pmd.load_file('my.mol2')
mol2_parm.save('my.pdb')

# and many more
```
