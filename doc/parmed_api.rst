The API for ParmEd Command-line Utilities
=========================================

In some cases, ``parmed`` interpreter is insufficient to do what you need it
to do, or perhaps you want to use some of ``parmed``'s functionality in your own
Python script or program.

In that case, the ParmEd API is here! Every :class:`Action
<parmed.tools.actions.Action>` subclass is available for import from
:mod:`parmed.tools`. For a full listing of available actions, you are forward to
the auto-generated list in :doc:`the parmed page <parmed>`.

Importing the actions
---------------------

All actions can be imported from ``parmed.tools`` with the same camelcase shown
in the ``parmed`` page. Examples are shown below::

    >>> from parmed.tools import change, addLJType, changeRadii, tiMerge
    >>> from parmed.tools import setBond, deleteBond, addDihedral, addPDB

Using the actions
-----------------

Each of the actions described on the previous page can be invoked either on a
parm list (a few, like :doc:`interpolate`, actually *require* a parm list with
multiple topologies), or a raw :class:`AmberParm <parmed.amber.Amberparm>`
object. Note that some actions do not support all :class:`AmberParm
<parmed.amber.AmberParm>` subclasses (like those for the CHARMM or Amoeba
force fields).

The first step is to instantiate the action with the :class:`AmberParm
<parmed.amber.AmberParm>` instance as the first argument. The arguments that
each action requires in the ParmEd interpreter can then be given as separate
arguments to the constructor or all as a single string in the second argument.
Keyword arguments can optionally be given as keyword arguments to the action
constructor.

Examples of valid syntax for :doc:`addLJType` are shown below::

    from parmed.tools import addLJType
    from parmed.amber import AmberParm

    parm = AmberParm('trx.prmtop')

    # All arguments as one string, a la parmed
    action = addLJType(parm, "@1 radius 1.5 epsilon 0.5")

    # Equivalent; all arguments separate
    action = addLJType(parm, "@1", "radius", 1.5, "epsilon", 0.5)

    # Also equivalent; keyword arguments given as keywords
    action = addLJType(parm, "@1", radius=1.5, epsilon=0.5)

Note that simply *instantiating* the object does not do anything. You need to
explicitly *execute* it as well, as shown below (continuting from the example
above)::

    action.execute()

The informational message printed to the ParmEd output are available by casting
the action to a string::

    print str(action)

    # Equivalent:
    print '%s' % action
