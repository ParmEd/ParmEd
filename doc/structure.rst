The :mod:`structure` module
===========================

The :mod:`structure` module contains the core class defining systems of
particles -- the :class:`Structure` class. The API documentation makes this
class look intimidating, but its core features are the ``atoms`` attribute
(which is an :class:`AtomList`) and its ``residues`` attribute (which is a
:class:`ResidueList`). These two attributes are enough to write numerous files
(e.g., PDB and PDBx/mmCIF), and these are the only two attributes currently
populated through the PDB and mmCIF parsing routines.

:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` class
-----------------------------------------------------
.. currentmodule:: parmed.structure
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: structobj/

    Structure

The :class:`Structure` class may be instantiated directly, but is more often
created by one of the parsers (see below for :func:`load_file
<parmed.formats.registry.load_file>`) or extended to
support the structure files of various computational parmed programs.

Attributes of :class:`Structure` instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`Structure` class has many attributes that store the various
topological features and force field parameters of the molecular model. These
include valence bonds, angles, torsions, and other more complex valence bond
terms (like coupled-torsion correction maps and a variety of other terms
describing common vibrational modes in the AMOEBA force field).

Each of these attributes is stored in a :class:`TrackedList
<parmed.topologyobjects.TrackedList>` instance, which is a simple subclass of
the built-in ``list`` type that registers every time the list itself is changed
(e.g., by adding an item, deleting an item, swapping two items, etc.). In this
way, :class:`Structure` can determine whether or not certain cached attributes
need to be updated. This is particularly important for various subclasses, like
:class:`AmberParm <parmed.amber._amberparm.AmberParm>` in which the topological
arrays and a dictionary of "raw data" need to be kept synchronized.

You should never delete or reassign any of these list attributes---instead you
should delete all of the items from the list using the idiom ``del mylist[:]``.

Every :class:`Structure` instance has the following :class:`TrackedList
<parmed.topologyobjects.TrackedList>` attributes:

+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attribute          | Description                                                                                |
+====================+============================================================================================+
| bonds              | List of :class:`Bond <parmed.topologyobjects.Bond>` instances                              |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| angles             | List of :class:`Angle <parmed.topologyobjects.Angle>` instances                            |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| urey_bradleys      | List of :class:`UreyBradley <parmed.topologyobjects.UreyBradley>` instances                |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| dihedrals          | List of :class:`Dihedral <parmed.topologyobjects.Dihedral>` instances                      |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| impropers          | List of :class:`Improper <parmed.topologyobjects.Improper>` instances                      |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| cmaps              | List of :class:`Cmap <parmed.topologyobjects.Cmap>` instances                              |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| adjusts            | List of :class:`NonbondedException` <parmed.topologyobjects.NonbondedException>` instances |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| stretch_bends      | List of :class:`StretchBend <parmed.topologyobjects.StretchBend>` instances                |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| out_of_plane_bends | List of :class:`OutOfPlaneBend <parmed.topologyobjects.OutOfPlaneBend>` instances          |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| trigonal_angles    | List of :class:`TrigonalAngle <parmed.topologyobjects.TrigonalAngle>` instances            |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| torsion_torsions   | List of :class:`TorsionTorsion <parmed.topologyobjects.TorsionTorsion>` instances          |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| pi_torsions        | List of :class:`PiTorsion <parmed.topologyobjects.PiTorsion>` instances                    |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| chiral_frames      | List of :class:`ChiralFrame <parmed.topologyobjects.ChiralFrame>` instances                |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| multipole_frames   | List of :class:`MultipoleFrame <parmed.topologyobjects.MultipoleFrame>` instances          |
+--------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If the list is empty, then no terms of that type exist in the model.  All terms
from ``stretch_bends`` to the bottom are exclusive to the Amoeba force field.

In addition to those attributes, there is a list of parameter *types*
corresponding to each of those valence parameters as well (except for the chiral
and multipole frame lists).  For example, a ``bond_types``, ``angle_types``,
``urey_bradley_types``, ... etc, that contain the parameter type objects
(:class:`BondType <parmed.topologyobjects.BondType>`,
:class:`AngleType <parmed.topologyobjects.AngleType>`, and
:class:`BondType <parmed.topologyobjects.BondType>` objects, respectively, since
the Urey-Bradley term is identical in functional form to a simple bond). The
same warnings apply here---do not explicitly delete or reassign these lists.

There are also two *special* subclasses of :class:`TrackedList
<parmed.topologyobjects.TrackedList>` tracking ``atoms`` and ``residues``
(namely the :class:`AtomList <parmed.topologyobjects.AtomList>` and the
:class:`ResidueList <parmed.topologyobjects.ResidueList>` classes that have
extra functionality aiding in the automatic bookkeeping, as described below).

Automated Bookkeeping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the strengths of the :class:`Structure` class and its corresponding
components (such as :class:`Bond <parmed.topologyobjects.Bond>`) is that it
automates the process of *bookkeeping* for your structure's model. For instance,
creating a :class:`Bond <parmed.topologyobjects.Bond>` instance automatically
registers the pair of atoms involved in the bond as partners in the "bond
graph", which is used to determine atom connectivity. So when you create a
:class:`Bond <parmed.topologyobjects.Bond>` object, you should immediately add
it to that :class:`Structure`'s ``bonds`` attribute. Likewise, if you give that
bond a :class:`BondType <parmed.topologyobjects.BondType>`, you should
immediately add that instance to the ``bond_types`` attribute of the
:class:`Structure` instance as well.

If you plan on creating your own models directly through the :class:`Structure`
API, you are encouraged to use existing parsers as examples, such as those for
the AMBER, GROMACS, and CHARMM topology files.

Coordinate handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is often of interest to store (and use) a particular conformation of a
molecule defined by the Cartesian coordinates of each atom. A :class:`Structure`
need not have an assigned set of atomic positions (many files do not provide
them by default, such as Amber prmtops, CHARMM PSF, and GROMACS topologies, just
to name a few). Others *do* define them, such as PDB and PDBx/mmCIF files.

ParmEd offers limited support for coordinate handling, and supports a handful of
coordinate and trajectory file formats. However, it is *not* optimized for
trajectory analysis, as there are far superior libraries for doing that (e.g.,
`MDTraj <http://mdtraj.org>`_ and `pytraj <https://amber-md.github.io/pytraj>`_
to name two). However, it is still often desirable to have access to atomic
coordinates.

In a :class:`Structure` instance, coordinates can be accessed as the ``xx``,
``xy``, and ``xz`` attributes on each atom individually, *or* they can be
accessed from the ``coordinates`` attribute on the :class:`Structure` instance
itself. The ``coordinates`` attribute is a numpy array of shape ``(natom, 3)``.
For example::

    >>> import parmed as pmd
    >>> pdb = pmd.download_PDB('2koc')
    >>> pdb.atoms[0].xx, pdb.atoms[0].xy, pdb.atoms[0].xz
    (-8.886, -5.163, 9.647)
    >>> pdb.coordinates
    array([[ -8.886,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])

The ``coordinates`` attribute is simply a copy of the position attributes on
each atom (and is set to ``None`` if any of the atoms do not have defined
positions). As such, if you modify individual positions in the ``coordinates``
array, they will *not* actually change the locations of that atom. In fact, if
you change the ``coordinates`` array, all of the cached coordinates will be
discarded and replaced with a copy of the position attributes on each atom::

    >>> pdb.coordinates[0] = [0, 0, 0]
    >>> pdb.atoms[0].xx, pdb.atoms[0].xy, pdb.atoms[0].xz
    (-8.886, -5.163, 9.647)
    >>> pdb.coordinates
    array([[ -8.886,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])

Note if you change the position of the first atom directly, that does get
reflected in the coordinate array, but *not* in a reference to the old
coordinates -- i.e., the ``coordinates`` array is a cache that may be discarded
when it no longer matches the positions on each atom::

    >>> coords = pdb.coordinates
    >>> pdb.atoms[0].xx = 0; pdb.atoms[0].xy = 0; pdb.atoms[0].xz = 0
    >>> coords # A reference to the original cache!
    array([[ -8.886,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])
    >>> pdb.coordinates # A new cache is created
    array([[  0.   ,   0.   ,   0.   ],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])

This may seem surprising at first, but makes sense when you realize that
``Structure.coordinates`` is simply a descriptor that reports on the positions
of each atom.

However, *assigning* to the ``coordinates`` attribute has special meaning.  You
may assign any iterable of floating point numbers (must be reshape-able into a
numpy array with the last two dimensions being ``(natom, 3)``), which will be
automatically converted into a numpy array *and assigned to the individual
atoms*. For example, using the ``coords`` reference we stored in our previous
example and assigned to ``pdb.coordinates`` will reset the first atoms' position
to its original value::

    >>> pdb.coordinates = coords
    >>> pdb.atoms[0].xx, pdb.atoms[0].xy, pdb.atoms[0].xz
    (-8.8859999999999992, -5.1630000000000003, 9.6470000000000002)
    >>> pdb.coordinates
    array([[ -8.886,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])

This brings us to our last note about working with coordinates. Several file
types, like PDB and PDBx/mmCIF, permit storing multiple *conformations* of the
molecule. The ``coordinates`` attribute only returns the first one, and each
atom only stores a single x-, y-, and z-coordinate. However, :class:`Structure`
caches all of the conformations it reads (or is assigned). You can access all
conformers using the :meth:`Structure.get_coordinates` method, passing either a
conformer number or the word `'all'` to get all coordinates.

As an example, consider the PDB 2KOC, which is an NMR structure with 20
conformers::

    >>> pdb = pmd.download_PDB('2KOC')
    >>> pdb.get_coordinates(0)
    array([[ -8.886,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])
    >>> pdb.get_coordinates(1)
    array([[-10.637,  -4.586,  11.116],
           [-11.86 ,  -5.331,  10.426],
           [-13.048,  -4.453,  10.55 ],
           ..., 
           [ -9.703,   4.539,   3.584],
           [-10.407,   5.725,   1.585],
           [-11.594,   5.52 ,  -0.533]])
    >>> pdb.get_coordinates(19)
    array([[-10.439,  -4.998,   9.616],
           [-11.992,  -4.669,   9.507],
           [-12.19 ,  -3.251,   9.891],
           ..., 
           [-10.938,   4.441,   2.276],
           [-11.359,   5.537,   0.158],
           [-12.051,   5.205,  -2.146]])
    >>> pdb.get_coordinates().shape # default is 'all'
    (20, 451, 3)

Be careful, though! Anything you do that makes the first conformer differ from
the positions on each of the atoms will invalidate the cache and delete *all*
conformers, as shown below::

    >>> pdb.atoms[0].xx = 0 # Invalidates cached coordinates!
    >>> pdb.coordinates
    array([[  0.   ,  -5.163,   9.647],
           [-10.305,  -4.745,  10.229],
           [-10.282,  -3.296,  10.528],
           ..., 
           [ -9.693,   3.638,   2.337],
           [-10.552,   4.682,   0.317],
           [-11.877,   4.323,  -1.696]])
    >>> pdb.get_coordinates().shape # only one frame now...
    (1, 451, 3)

**Performance note**

The way that ParmEd ensures that ``Structure.coordinates`` is always correct is
to generate a new numpy array from the positions each time the attribute is
accessed. As a result, repeated access to ``Structure.coordinates`` can be
*very* slow, and should be avoided. Iterating over the coordinates directly
requires only a single access, as does storing a reference to it and accessing
that instead. Below, I show some performance timings from IPython for a simple
task of finding the lowest x-coordinate value among all atoms::

    In [1]: import parmed as pmd
    
    In [2]: def slow_min_x(struct):
       ...:     return min([struct.coordinates[i][0]
       ...:                 for i in range(len(struct.atoms))])
       ...: 
    
    In [3]: def iter_min_x(struct):
       ...:     return min([x[0] for x in struct.coordinates])
       ...: 
    
    In [4]: def ref_min_x(struct):
       ...:     coords = struct.coordinates
       ...:     return min([coords[i][0] for i in range(len(struct.atoms))])
       ...: 
    
    In [5]: pmd.download_PDB('4lzt')
    Out[5]: <Structure 1164 atoms; 274 residues; 0 bonds; PBC (triclinic); NOT parametrized>
    
    In [6]: struct = pmd.download_PDB('4lzt')
    
    In [7]: %timeit slow_min_x(struct)
    1 loops, best of 3: 1.08 s per loop
    
    In [8]: %timeit iter_min_x(struct)
    1000 loops, best of 3: 1.2 ms per loop
    
    In [9]: %timeit ref_min_x(struct)
    1000 loops, best of 3: 1.29 ms per loop

Notice -- the ``slow_min_x`` function is about 1000x slower than all of the
others! This is a contrived example, but it shows the danger of repeatedly
accessing elements of ``Structure.coordinates`` instead of iterating over it or
working with a reference to the cached numpy array.

Structure manipulation: slicing, combining, replicating, and splitting
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes a number of simple, yet powerful manipulations you can do
to :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instances (and, by
extension, instances of their subclasses).  In order, these are *slicing*,
*combining* (or *merging*), and *replicating*.

:class:`Structure` Slicing and Selections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the things that ParmEd tries to make easy to do is to select a subset of
a :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instance as a new
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` (complete with all
remaining atoms, residues, and parameters) by using the common Python idiom of
`slicing <http://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-slice-listsarrays-and-tuples-in-python/>`_.
The *slice*, or *selection* syntax of :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` is designed to be flexible, expressive, and
intuitive (although accomplishing all of these is a challenge!).

There are three many ways to select from a :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance:

1. By atom index
2. By Amber selection mask (see :class:`AmberMask <parmed.amber.AmberMask>`)
3. By selection arrays, mask arrays, or slices of chains, residues, and/or
   atoms.

When selecting from a :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>`
instance, the return value can be one of two things:

1. :class:`Atom <parmed.topologyobjects.Atom>` instance if the selection
   specified only a single atom either by atom index, atom index *within* a
   residue index, or an atom index *within* a residue index *within* a single
   chain.
2. :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` with all of the selected
   atoms and all parameters that were present between the selected atoms. In
   this case, a copy is made of all selected atoms. If no atoms were selected,
   the resulting structure is empty, and will evaluate to boolean ``False``.
   Note that selections return the same type as the original object being
   selected, so the resulting object may be a subclass of :class:`Structure
   <parmed.structure.Structure>`.

**NOTE**

The return value of a selection---unless it is selecting a single atom---is a
*copy* of the original structure, meaning that changes to the result of the
slice will *not* change the structure from which you sliced.

This is not always desirable. In cases where you want the resulting structure to
contain the *same* atoms, residues, bonds, etc. as the original Structure so
that you can simplify the process of modifying a subset of the structure, you
want to use the ``view`` descriptor of :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instead.  This is described in more detail below.

**Let's look at the simplest form of the selection syntax -- by atom index**::

    >>> struct = load_file('4LZT.cif') # use the 4LZT.cif file in test/files/
    >>> struct
    <Structure 1164 atoms; 274 residues; 0 bonds; PBC; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[0]
    <Atom N [0]; In LYS 0>
    >>> struct[10]
    <Atom CA [10]; In VAL 1>
    >>> struct[1163]
    <Atom O [1163]; In HOH 273>
    >>> struct[-1]  # Negative indices also work!
    <Atom O [1163]; In HOH 273>
    >>> struct[1164]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/.../structure.py", line 1021, in __getitem__
        return self.atoms[selection]
      File "/.../topologyobjects.py", line 3932, in __getitem__
        retval = list.__getitem__(self, thing)
    IndexError: list index out of range

Oops!  Our original structure only had 1164 atoms, so selecting the 1165th index
(remember, Python indices start from 0) results in an ``IndexError``. As with
Python slicing, though, slice and Amber mask selections simply return ``None``
if no atoms match the selection.

**Now let's look at the slightly more complex Amber mask selection. See** `Amber
mask syntax <amber.html#amber-mask-syntax>`_ **for more details**.

If you pass a single string, it will be interpreted as an Amber mask. The
example below continues from the same ``struct`` we were using above::

    >>> struct['@CA']
    <Structure 129 atoms; 129 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[':1-10']
    <Structure 75 atoms; 10 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[':1-10@CA,CB']
    <Structure 19 atoms; 10 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[':10<@5']
    <Structure 49 atoms; 13 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[':10<:5']
    <Structure 88 atoms; 13 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>

**Now let's look at mask arrays**.

I'll define my terminology.  A *mask array* is a boolean array (or it is
interpreted as a boolean array) with a Truthy-value (e.g., ``True``, ``1``,
etc.) for atoms you want to select and a Falsey-value (e.g., ``False``, ``0``,
etc.) for atoms you do *not* want to select.  A *selection array*, described in
more detail below, is an array of atom indices (first index is 0) of the atoms
you want to select. These arrays can be any subscriptable iterable (e.g.,
``tuple``, ``list``, ``numpy.ndarray``, etc.).

A *mask array* must have the same number of elements as your system has atoms.
So if an array has the same number of elements as you have atoms, it is
interpreted as a mask array.  A common use-case for a mask array is to convert a
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` to a Pandas ``DataFrame``
(see :func:`Structure.to_dataframe <parmed.structure.Structure.to_dataframe>`
for more information), and using Pandas/numpy to generate the mask array. An
example of this is shown below::

    >>> df = struct.to_dataframe()
    >>> struct[df.name == 'CA']
    <Structure 129 atoms; 129 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[(df.name == 'CA')&(df.resid < 10)]
    <Structure 10 atoms; 10 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>

A mask array cannot be used alongside a residue or chain selection. In fact,
ParmEd will simply interpret that array as a selection array, which may lead to
unexpected results, as seen below::

    >>> struct['A',:,df.name == 'CA']
    <Structure 409 atoms; 274 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>

While you might expect this to select only the ``CA`` atoms (since all residues
are in chain A), the key is that ``df.name == 'CA'`` is interpreted as a
selection array, and it contains 0s and 1s. So it selects the first two atoms of
every residue (not all residues have more than 1 atom, though, which is why the
number of atoms is not double the number of residues).

**Now let's look at selection arrays and slices of chains, residues, and/or
atoms**

:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instances can take between 1
and 3 "slots" in their indexing scheme, corresponding to atom, residue, and
chain selections.  If one slot is used, that selection applies to the list of
atoms.  If two slots are used, the first slot applies to the list of residues
while the second slot refers to the list of atoms *within the selected
residues*. Note the difference between the atom selections when a residue
selection is given compared to when one is not. If all three slots are used, the
first is interpreted as a chain selection, the second as a selection of residues
*within each selected chain* and the third as a selection of each atom *within
those residues*.

Slots can be assigned either an index, string, slice, or selection array. Each
is defined below:

- An *index* is a number between 0 and the number of elements in either the
  residue or atom list (depending on which slot is found in).
- A *string* is interpreted as a single name that must match every chain,
  residue, or atom name (as determined by the slot it is found in).
- A *slice* is a standard Python slice (e.g., ``iterable[10:20:2]``) and can be
  used for either the residue or atom selections. A raw ``:`` in any slot means
  a "full slice" that selects everything according to its slot.
- A *selection array* is an array of indexes or strings (interpreted as names),
  and can have as many elements as you want (including negative numbers to count
  from the *end* of the atom list). but no atom index can be outside the range
  of the atom list (or you will get an ``IndexError``). So practically speaking,
  there is no use-case for a selection array to have the same length as a mask
  array, since that would either include duplicates *or* select every atom.

Let's have a look at some examples, again continuing with the ``struct`` object
we defined above::

    >>> struct[10:20:2]
    <Structure 5 atoms; 2 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[0,10:20:2] # note, this is the 10th to 20th atom of the 1st residue!
    >>> struct[:,0] # First atom of every residue
    <Structure 274 atoms; 274 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct['A',:,:] # All atoms in chain A
    <Structure 1164 atoms; 274 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>
    >>> struct[:,'CA'] # All atoms named CA in all residues
    <Structure 129 atoms; 129 residues; 0 bonds; NOT parametrized>

There is so much flexiblity in the Atom selection here that we can't possibly
cover everything. You are encouraged to try things out!

Structure views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous section, we alluded to a way of applying the selection syntax to
obtain a *view* of a structure, rather than a full copy of the subset of
selected atoms. You still need to familiarize yourself with the selection
syntax, as it is the same when you are trying to take a view.

However, instead of selecting directly from the :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance, you instead select from
``Structure.view``, as demonstrated below on a downloaded PDB::

    >>> import parmed as pmd
    >>> pdb = pmd.download_PDB('4lzt')
    >>> pdb.residues[0]
    <Residue LYS[1]; chain=A>
    >>> # Changing a slice does NOT change the original
    ... pdb[:1,:].residues[0].name = 'MOL'
    >>> pdb.residues[0]
    <Residue LYS[1]; chain=A>
    >>> # However, changing a view DOES change the original
    ... pdb.view[:1,:].residues[0].name = 'MOL'
    >>> pdb.residues[0]
    <Residue MOL[1]; chain=A>

Structure Combining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two structures can be *combined* in the sense that a :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance can be created by taking the atoms,
residues, and parameters of one ``Structure`` and tacking it on to the end of
another one.

This can naturally be thought of as a *sum* of two ``Structure`` instances, so
it was implemented via the addition operator.  This can be done both in-place
(in a way that modifies the first ``Structure``) as well as creating a new copy
that is the sum of the originals. This is demonstrated below using AMBER
topology files of two small molecules, phenol and biphenyl, which can be found
in the ``test/files`` directory of the ParmEd distribution (``phenol.prmtop``
and ``biphenyl.prmtop``)::

    >>> phenol = load_file('phenol.prmtop')
    >>> biphenyl = load_file('biphenyl.prmtop')
    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> biphenyl
    <AmberParm 22 atoms; 1 residues; 23 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> phenol + biphenyl
    <AmberParm 35 atoms; 2 residues; 36 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> # Note that neither phenol or biphenyl have changed
    ... phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> biphenyl
    <AmberParm 22 atoms; 1 residues; 23 bonds; parametrized>

Note that the order of addition controls the order that the atoms are added to
the resulting :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>`, as you would
probably expect::

    >>> [len(residue) for residue in (phenol + biphenyl).residues]
    [13, 22]
    >>> [len(residue) for residue in (biphenyl + phenol).residues]
    [22, 13]

In-place addition is also supported, which can be noticeably more efficient than
combining using standard addition, particularly for large systems. Note, if you
are adding a large and a small structure together, adding the small one to the
large one in-place is the most efficient way to do that. In-place combination is
demonstrated below::

    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> biphenyl
    <AmberParm 22 atoms; 1 residues; 23 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> phenol += biphenyl
    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 35 atoms; 2 residues; 36 bonds; parametrized>

The addition preserves both the valence terms and the parameters from both
structures.  All of the parameter *type* arrays (e.g., ``bond_types``) will be
the sum of the type arrays from the two structures (you will see why this is
important in the next section about *replicating* structures).

One final comment to make is in regards to the type of the resulting
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instance.  You can add any
two :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instances together,
including instances of subclasses (such as :class:`AmberParm
<parmed.amber._amberparm.AmberParm>`). The result will take the type of the
*first* operand.

Structure Replicating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you also want to model several copies of the same
structure. Like with structure combining (described above), *replicating* is
implemented by overloading the natural mathematical operator -- the
multiplication operator (``*``).

The only mode supported here is multiplying a :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance by an integer, which indicates the
number of copies of the original structure will be added to the result.  And
like with combination, replication can be done both in-place and not::

    >>> phenol = load_file('phenol.prmtop')
    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> phenol * 2
    <AmberParm 26 atoms; 2 residues; 26 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> 100 * phenol # multiplication can commute
    <AmberParm 1300 atoms; 100 residues; 1300 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> # phenol still hasn't changed
    ... phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> # In-place replicate... phenol WILL change now
    ... phenol *= 10
    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 130 atoms; 10 residues; 130 bonds; parametrized>

One comment about the parameter *type* arrays (e.g., ``bond_type``) -- unlike
structure combination, all replicates have the *same* parameters, so there is no
reason to enlarge the type arrays. As a result, all valence terms in each
replicate points to the *same* parameter type as that same valence term in the
other replicates.

As a result, adding a structure to itself will result in an *equivalent*
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instance (in that it will
have the same atom and residue order, valence terms and their order, and each
parameter will have the same type), but combining a structure with itself will
double the size of its type arrays, while replicating it will not.

Finally, replication is more efficient than combination arising from the simpler
nature of replicating a structure than combining two different ones.

:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` splitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you want to be able to manipulate individual *molecules* inside a
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instance individually. The
:meth:`Structure.split <parmed.structure.Structure.split>` method does just
this.  It uses the bond graph in order to identify which atoms belong to which
molecules and then return a list of molecules along with how many times that
molecule occurs in the original :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance.

It only returns one copy of each molecule due to the cost of splitting off
potentially thousands of solvent molecules in larger solvated systems.  As a
result, the return value is a list of ``tuple`` instances where each tuple is
the :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` (or subclass) instances
followed by the number of times that structure occurs.  Using our phenol and
biphenyl examples from earlier::

    >>> phenol = load_file('test/files/phenol.prmtop')
    >>> biphenyl = load_file('test/files/biphenyl.prmtop')
    >>> phenol
    <AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> biphenyl
    <AmberParm 22 atoms; 1 residues; 23 bonds; parametrized>
    >>> (phenol*10 + biphenyl*10).split()
    [(<AmberParm 13 atoms; 1 residues; 13 bonds; parametrized>, 10), (<AmberParm 22 atoms; 1 residues; 23 bonds; parametrized>, 10)]

:func:`load_file <parmed.formats.registry.load_file>`
--------------------------------------------------------
.. currentmodule:: parmed.formats.registry
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: structobj/

    load_file

The :func:`load_file` function automatically determines the format of the file
whose name is passed as an argument. The following formats are currently
recognized and result in the instantiation of either a :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>`. or one of its subclasses:

1. PDB
2. PDBx/mmCIF
3. Gromacs GRO
4. Gromacs topology file
5. Amber topology file
6. CHARMM PSF file
7. Mol2 file

Here, we will focus on instantiating a :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` instance from PDB and
mmCIF files.  PDB files and mmCIF files downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data
Bank or the world wide Protein Data Bank often contain a large amount of
metadata describing the structure, such as the citation information,
experimental method (e.g., X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy), authors,
and related database entries (such as BMRB entries for NMR-solved structures).
This information is extracted from both PDB and PDBx/mmCIF files when available,
along with anisotropic B-factors.

The following sections will briefly demonstrate parsing a PDB file and a mmCIF
file to a :class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` instance.

Examples
--------

For the purposes of this example, we will download the 4LZT structure as both a
PDB file and a CIF file. These structures are both used in the ParmEd unittest
suite, so you can get the files from there, or `download them from here.`__

.. _4lzt_structures: http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4LZT
__ 4lzt_structures_

------

The first example demonstrates reading the PDB file::

    >>> from parmed import load_file
    >>> lzt_pdb = load_file('4lzt.pdb')
    >>> len(lzt_pdb.atoms)
    1164
    >>> len(lzt_pdb.residues)
    274
    >>> lzt_pdb.experimental # See the experimental method
    'X-RAY DIFFRACTION'
    >>> # See how many chains we have
    >>> chain_list = set()
    >>> for residue in lzt_pdb.residues:
    ...     chain_list.add(residue.chain)
    ... 
    >>> chain_list
    set(['A'])
    >>> # Only one chain. Now see how many atoms have alternate conformations
    >>> atoms_with_altconf = [atom for atom in lzt_pdb.atoms
    ...                           if atom.other_locations]
    >>> len(atoms_with_altconf)
    19
    >>> # Just for sanity's sake, make sure that the sum of all atoms in all
    >>> # residues is equal to the total number of atoms
    >>> sum(len(residue) for residue in lzt_pdb.residues)
    1164
    >>> len(lzt_pdb.atoms)
    1164
    >>> lzt_pdb.atoms[0].anisou # Look, we even get anisotropic B-factors!
    array([ 0.2066,  0.1204,  0.1269,  0.0044,  0.0126,  0.0191])

The second example demonstrates reading the CIF file::

    >>> from parmed import load_file
    >>> lzt_cif = load_file('4LZT.cif')
    >>> len(lzt_cif.atoms)
    1164
    >>> len(lzt_cif.residues)
    274
    >>> lzt_cif.experimental # See the experimental method
    'X-RAY DIFFRACTION'
    >>> # See how many chains we have
    >>> chain_list = set()
    >>> for residue in lzt_cif.residues:
    ...     chain_list.add(residue.chain)
    ... 
    >>> chain_list
    set(['A'])
    >>> # Only one chain. Now see how many atoms have alternate conformations
    >>> atoms_with_altconf = [atom for atom in lzt_cif.atoms
    ...                          if atom.other_locations]
    >>> len(atoms_with_altconf)
    19
    >>> # Just for sanity's sake, make sure that the sum of all atoms in all
    >>> # residues is equal to the total number of atoms
    >>> sum(len(residue) for residue in lzt_cif.residues)
    1164
    >>> len(lzt_pdb.atoms)
    1164
    >>> lzt_cif.atoms[0].anisou # Look, we even get anisotropic B-factors!
    array([ 0.2066,  0.1204,  0.1269,  0.0044,  0.0126,  0.0191])

Converting PDBx/mmCIF files to PDB files
----------------------------------------

If you noticed the ``write_cif`` and ``write_pdb`` methods attached to the
:class:`Structure <parmed.structure.Structure>` class, you may have deduced
that you can very simply convert a PDBx/mmCIF file to a PDB file.

This is likely to be increasingly popular, since the PDB is moving to the mmCIF
format, but many programs in the field of computational parmed and physics
has decades worth of legacy code built around PDB files. Not to worry!  A quick
1-liner will seamlessly convert PDBx to PDB::

    from parmed import load_file
    load_file('4LZT.cif').write_pdb('4lzt_converted.pdb', write_anisou=True,
                                    renumber=False)

In this case, the metadata is *not* copied (i.e., the ``EXPTL``, ``JRNL``,
and ``AUTHOR`` records, to name a few). Only the coordinates, unit cell
(``CYRST1`` record), and optionally anisotropic B-factor lines are translated.

The ``renumber`` argument tells :class:`Structure
<parmed.structure.Structure>` to use the original PDB numbers, rather than
its internal number scheme that numbers sequentially from 1 to N, where N is
the number of residues.

If your system has more than 99,999 atoms (and/or more than 9,999 residues), the
numbering cycles back, such that the atom serial number after 99,999 is 0, and
the numbering starts again.
