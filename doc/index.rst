ParmEd
======

ParmEd is a general tool for aiding in investigations of biomolecular systems
using popular molecular simulation packages, like Amber, CHARMM, and OpenMM
written in Python.

What is it?
-----------

There are two parts to ParmEd -- the Python API that exposes the core classes
used in its modeling capabilities, and two front-end Python programs
(``parmed.py`` and its GUI counterpart, ``xparmed.py``) that make use of the
ParmEd API to allow rapid prototyping and parameter-topology modifications for
use in molecular simulations.

Why use it?
-----------

You can use it for a variety of modeling purposes, like manipulating system
topologies (i.e., the *atoms*, *bonds*, and other bonded terms like valence
angles) and translating between file formats (e.g., PDB, mmCIF/PDBx, Amber
*prmtop*, and CHARMM *psf*).  What sets ParmEd apart from tools like OpenBabel
is that it stores and tracks force field parameters so that the resulting files
can be used to carry out molecular mechanics simulations with tools like Amber,
OpenMM, NAMD, and CHARMM.

ParmEd has sophisticated machinery built into its core classes that
substantially reduces the burden of bookkeeping when manipulating chemical
structures (for instance, adding or deleting an atom from a structure
automatically updates the indices in each of the parameter arrays defining the
system topology so you don't have to worry about it).

What can it do?
---------------

The core ``chemistry`` package provided as part of ParmEd is intended to provide
a powerful, but simple, API for carrying out tasks common in the field of
biomolecular simulations.  For example, some of its features include:

    - Simply iterate through atoms as well as other parameters found in common
      molecular mechanical force fields
    - Rapidly modify a system topology and its parameters, and write files that
      can be used with the Amber and CHARMM program suites (as well as other
      programs that support those file types, like NAMD)
    - Carry out investigations using force fields, like molecular dynamics,
      directly on modern, high-performance hardware (like Graphics Processing
      Units) using the *OpenMM* library and Python application layer
    - Dimensional analysis with a complete system of physical units
    - Translate between a variety of file formats in common use by various
      programs including:

        + Amber prmtop, inpcrd, NetCDF trajectory, and NetCDF restart files
        + CHARMM PSF, coordinate, and restart files
        + PDB files, supporting a wide range of dialects that technically
          violate the PDB standard
        + PDBx/mmCIF files -- the new standard for the Protein Data Bank

    - Extract metadata from the PDB and PDBx/mmCIF files, such as citation
      information and related database entries
